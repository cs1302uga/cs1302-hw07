### Exercise Steps

1. For this homework assignment, you will submit the completed code from the 
   [CSCI 1302 JavaFX Starter Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/alsi/javafx/javafx.md) assigned
   as a reading earlier this week.
   
1. If you haven't done so already, go ahead and click the link for the JavaFX tutorial, complete the tutorial, and then submit
   your `cs1302-javafx` folder using the instructions below.

### Submission Steps

**Each student needs to individually submit their own work.**

1. Create a plain text file called `SUBMISSION.md` directly inside the `cs1302-javafx`
   directory with the following information:

   1. Your name and UGA ID number
  
   Here is an example of the contents of `SUBMISSION.md`:
   
   ```
   Sally Smith (811-000-999)
   ```

1. Change directories to the parent of `cs1302-javafx` (e.g., `cd ..` from `cs1302-javafx`). If you would like
   to make a backup `.tar` file, the instructions are in the submissions steps for [hw01](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-hw01).
   We won't repeat those steps here and you can view them as optional.
   
1. Use the `submit` command to submit this exercise to `csci-1302`:
   
   ```
   $ submit cs1302-javafx csci-1302
   ```
   
   Read the output of the submit command very carefully. If there is an error while submitting, then it will displayed 
   in that output. Additionally, if successful, the `submit` command creates a new receipt file in the directory you 
   submitted. The receipt file begins with "rec" and contains a detailed list of all files that were successfully submitted. 
   Look through the contents of the receipt file and always remember to keep that file in case there is an issue with your submission.

   **Note:** You must be on Odin to submit.
